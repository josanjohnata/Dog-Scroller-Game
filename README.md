# Dog-Scroller-Game
This is a side-scroller game with animated sprites, endlessly scrolling backgrounds and a simple scoring system. I used just vanilla JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS, no frameworks and no libraries. This game was created for my 6 year old daughter and if she enjoys it, I will develop it for mobile devices. Have fun!
